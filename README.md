Small Object Detection - Roboflow Trained Models 

We are working with computer vision to detect moving images on screen. Once those images have been detected, we can create algorithms to accomplish tasks.

Here we see examples of moving objects being targeted using PyAutoGui, screenshot, and cv.

Initially, we trained the model using roboflow to create confidences of certain objects. Later in the script we targeted only models that received 
high enough confidence.
